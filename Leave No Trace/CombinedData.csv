The egg clutch had not been found and Mike Reynolds came to assist at 8:30 am. However, the nest area had been so disturbed by the search, he was unable to locate the eggs. The search was suspended at 9:30 when it started raining. Team leaders Denise and Joe Spafford returned later and resumed the search. The eggs were found and the nest processing was completed.
7/16/15, Park employees reported that the nest was going to be washed away by the tide around 11 am. By the time team leaders Denise and Joe Spafford arrived the nest was breached on the water side where a 4 foot escarpment had formed. The high tide was caused by a tropical depression in the gulf. Due to the nest being in the late days of development, Mike Reynolds gave permission to relocate the nest. Team leaders moved 94 eggs and 4 shells to a new nest 30 feet from the water. About 1/2 the eggs appeared to be at the right stage of development or viable and the 4 shells were probably predated by ghost crabs.
7/23/15, The nest was tarped using 1 36 inch tarp in a U shape around the nest and 1 18 inch tarp on each side flared to the water. A trench was not necessary. 
7/29/15, The nest began hatching with 1 turtle emerging late pm and headed to the water. We scheduled the excavation for 7/31/15 because we had heard no other noises from the nest after the first turtle emerged. We began the excavation and found 11 live turtles so we covered up the nest and continued to monitor it. Those turtles emerged later that night and 28 more the following night. The nest was excavated 8/2/15."

Nest was tarped and trenched. 
Began excavation on August 9th, found 13 live hatchlings, reburied and completed excavation the next day. Of those, 8 hatchlings emerged right away after being reburied and went to water. 2 emerged later with no one there, 1 to water, and 1 fate unknown assumed not to water and subtracted from estimated to water. 1 hatchling found predated subtracted from estimated to water. Both of these hatchlings (2) were put under Hatched but Dead in Nest and NOT in Escaped from Nest in order to maintain the correct numbers for Total Eggs, Estimated to Water and Survival Percentage.

After final excavation on August 10th, 31 live hatchlings found in nest and released. Obtained permission from Diane Ingram to release that many due to the presence of coyote tracks in tarped area.
There was a good bit of disorientation for released hatchlings.

The turtle nested right after coming on the beach. After she was finished nesting she wandered on the beach for more than 80 yards and disturbed a second area like she was going to nest again. She headed to the water after the second disturbed area.
8/6/15, The nest was tarped using 1 36 inch tarp in a U shape around the nest and 2 18 inch tarps on each side, flared at the end. There was no trench.
8/11/15, the nest began to hatch with one turtle emerging  late morning and found by the park ranger on patrol. The ranger notified Mike Reynolds and then saw the turtle to the water before team leaders arrived. Since there were no other turtles hatching, normal sitting resumed that afternoon. Later that night, 71 turtles emerged and headed to the water without any problems. The remaining 21 turtles hatched the following night. The tarp system worked well to guide the turtles to the water.
8/14/15, The nest was excavated by team leaders Denise Spafford and Fran Shults and team member Bob Parris."

Nest monitoring began at day 55 but there were no sounds heard.
